Imagine you were hosting an out-of-town visitor. Where would you take them to show off the best of your local area? Please share what favorite place or attraction you'd take them and why you like it.|We’d visit a local farmers’ market or street fair. It’s a great way to experience the local culture, try some fresh food, and meet people from the community. I love the lively atmosphere and how it showcases the best of what our town has to offer.
